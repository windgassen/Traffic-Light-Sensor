# Traffic-Light-Sensor Build 1.00
This program is an Arduino sketch that is designed to control a traffic light using solid state relays.
It sequences the lights from green to yellow to red and then back again.
There is also an ultrasonic rangefinder which sets the light to green as soon as it detects a car.
The traffic light stays green as long as the car is detected.
